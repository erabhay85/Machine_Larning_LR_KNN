Write a python script
BEST FIT LINE - Calling SKlearn linear regression
Ex 1. Data:
1. Download the MPG data file from UCI Machine Learning repository
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/auto-mpg/
2. Identify target variable and independent variable.
3. Prepare the data file
Univariate Regression
Ex 2. Import relevant python libraries and sklearn linear_model
Ex 3. Split the file into train [80%] and test [20%] data
Ex 4. Apply linear regression
Ex 5.Train the model using the training sets
Ex 6.Display the coefficients coef, intercept and residues
Ex 7.Predict using test data
Ex 8. Perform Accuracy check using the R Square
Ex 9. Display using scatter plot the data points and the best fit line
Multi-variate Regression
Repeat the above steps
BEST FIT LINE - Cost function using un-constrained method - Gradient descent
Ex 1. Use the downloaded data
Ex 2. Convert this data to array
Ex 3. Define the learning rate and no. of iterations as 0.0001 and 1000 respectively along with yintercept
and slope
Ex 4. Create the functions to get the BEST FIT line
1. Compute error for the line given the points
2. Step gradient function
3. Gradient descent
Ex 5. Display using scatter plot the data points and the best fit line
Ex 6. Display the Gradient and y-intercept value in the form y = mx+c
Ex 7. Find the BEST FIT line i.e., m and c of y=mx+c with least error using trial and error method
i.e., modify learning rate or iterations or both
Machine Learning KNN assignments
Ex 1. Data:
1. Download the census data file from UCI Machine Learning repository
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/adult/
2. Identify target variable and independent variable.
3. Prepare the data file
Ex 2. Import relevant python libraries and sklearn KNN model
Ex 3. Split the file into train [80%] and test [20%] data
Ex 4. Apply KNN algorithm
Ex 5. Train the model using the training set
Ex 6. Predict using test data
Ex 8. Perform Accuracy check
